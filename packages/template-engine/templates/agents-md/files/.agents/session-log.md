# Session Log

A running record of AI-assisted work sessions. After each session, append an
entry using the template below. Keep entries short — this is a memory aid for
the next session, not documentation.

Unlike the other `.agents/*.md` spec files (which AGENTS.md marks "never edit"),
this file is **append-only by design** — adding session entries is expected.

To keep this file out of version control, add `.agents/session-log.md` to
`.gitignore`.

## Template (copy for each session)

**Session:** YYYY-MM-DD — topic

- **Mode:** Implementer
- **Changes:**
  - (what was edited, at a file/feature level)
- **Decisions:**
  - (choices made and the reason, so they are not relitigated)
- **Left open:**
  - (follow-ups, known gaps, anything the next session should pick up)
